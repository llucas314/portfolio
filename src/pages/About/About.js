                A mentor told me the best things in life come from living
                outside of your comfort zone, and I have lived by that
                principle. Ever since I left my friends and family, joined the
                Air Force, traveled the world, and even flew a fighter jet. Now,
                I have left the comfort of the military to pursue my dream of
                becoming a software developer. I know it can be difficult, but
                my diverse background has given me an amazing set of skills that
                have prepared me to be flexible and thrive under pressure.

                Although I did not realize my passion for coding until later in
                life, Iâ€™ve always been a problem solver. Whether it was a jigsaw
                puzzle or diagnosing computer issues, I wanted and needed to
                find solutions to each of the problems presented to me. After I
                was introduced to programming, I knew that I had found a career
                that fit me perfectly. In a constantly changing industry, I am
                continuously pushing myself outside of my comfort zone, learning
                new languages and frameworks to become a versatile software
                engineer.
